## 🎯 Next Steps (Immediate Priority)

### 1. Create Prisma Schema
- Define database models (User, Category, Product, Customer, Order)
- Set up relations and constraints
- Run initial migration
- Generate Prisma Client

### 2. Implement Backend API Routes
- **Authentication**: POST `/api/auth/login`
- **Categories**: GET `/api/categories`
- **Products**: GET `/api/products`, GET `/api/products/:id`
- **Customers**: GET `/api/customers?phone={number}`, POST `/api/customers`
- **Orders**: POST `/api/orders`, GET `/api/orders`

### 3. Build Frontend Pages
- **Home**: Tab navigation (Catalog, Orders, Pending)
- **Catalog**: Category selection and product grid
- **Cart**: Item list with quantity controls
- **Checkout**: Customer lookup, discount, tax, payment selection
- **Confirmation**: Order success with email notification

### 4. Integrate Frontend with Backend
- API service layer with axios
- Authentication flow (login → store JWT → protected routes)
- State management for cart and user session
- Error handling and loading states

### 5. Add Business Logic
- Customer lookup by phone
- Discount calculation (5% existing, membership new)
- Indian GST tax calculation
- Payment gateway mock
- Email notification (console logging)

## 🔧 Technical Achievements

### Architecture
- **Monorepo**: Clean separation of concerns with shared types
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end TypeScript prevents runtime errors
- **Modern Stack**: React 18, Vite 5, Express 4, Prisma 5
- **Dev Experience**: Hot reload on both frontend and backend
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with consistent JSON responses

### Security
- JWT authentication planned
- API key management (Anthropic key server-side only)
- Environment variables for secrets
- CORS configured for local development

### Scalability
- Workspace structure supports adding more packages
- Shared types prevent client/server drift
- Prisma ORM enables easy database migration
- Mock services allow offline development

## 🎓 Learnings & Insights

### What Worked Well
1. **Monorepo Structure**: Keeps related code together, simplifies dependency management
2. **TypeScript Shared Package**: Eliminates type mismatches between client and server
3. **Vite**: Extremely fast development experience with HMR
4. **Memory Bank**: Provides complete context for future development sessions
5. **Mock Fallbacks**: AI and payment mocks enable development without external dependencies

### Challenges Overcome
1. **PowerShell Execution Policy**: Solved by using `cmd /c` wrapper
2. **Missing Type Definitions**: Identified and installed @types packages
3. **Workspace Dependencies**: Configured proper package linking
4. **Concurrent Servers**: Set up concurrently for smooth development

### Best Practices Established
1. Environment variables in .env (not committed)
2. Seed scripts for sample data
3. Comprehensive documentation for context preservation
4. Type-safe API contracts
5. Error handling patterns
